# Hi, I'm Connor 

## About Me 
- I'm attending the [University of Manitoba](https://www.umanitoba.ca/) as a Computer Science Honours Undergrad, where I'll be entering the Co-op program beginning Winter 2025.
- I am interested in everything Computer Science, Software Engineering, Data Science, and the ways in which I can interact with the real world using things I've learned.

### Projects 
- **Friend Locator**: Geolocation web compass app that you can log into and follow to find your friend when lost at a large gathering.
- **Chess**: Written in Javascript, I have intentions to implement an AI opponent
- **Themed Background Switcher**: You input a theme (such as Polar Bears!), a cycle duration, and thats it! The program will scrape the web for beuatiful backgrounds!
- **Firefox Extension**: A modification of another extension that will automatically cancel any downloads. A safety precaution, but also an easy way to grab download links.
- **Class Tree Hiearchy**: Prints a tree-like output of your project's class hierarchy, recently added support for C++.
- **Wordle Terminal**: Accesses an API to retrieve the current New York Times Wordle word of the day and implements the proper logic to guess for the correct word.
- **Image to Text**: Run a command, highlight the text, voila! The text is now in your clipboard.
- **Telegram Bot**: A bot and guide to run a simple command to be notified when one of your (very long) commands *finally* finishes executing.
- **Merch Sales**: I created a shopify website where I sold around 20 Sweaters as a side project, as I saw that there was a demand for them.
- **Other**: I like to make small command line tools, such as an easy way to knit R code, that way I can use my preferred IDE: Neovim.

### Hobbies 
- **Volleyball**:  Currently playing on a Winnipeg Mens team
- **Chess**: Mostly online but occasionally attend some in-person UofM events
- **Working Out**: I like to do body strength exercises and train my jumping for Volleyball
- **Youtube**: I have experimented with creating videos where I hacked games, currently I have a channel with 6000 Subscribers.
- **Linux**: Tinkering with everything Linux is a love of mine, currently I am daily driving [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/) and [Hyprland](https://hyprland.org/).

### What I've Been Doing Recently 
- Recently I have been helping out at [Computer Science Students Association](https://www.umanitobacssa.ca/) Lounge, where I am a certified supervisor. And it is a great place to study!
- This Winter I'm taking Object Orientation, Analysis of Algorithms and Data Structures, and Introduction to Computer Systems. Which will finish off all second year courses.
- Last Fall I took two High-level math courses (including a data science class) and the honours-required Computer Science Automata Class (COMP 3030). Allowing me to finish my mathematics minor.
- Attended [CUSEC 2025](https://2025.cusec.net/).
